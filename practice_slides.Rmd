## Intro to R Markdown {.build}

-   What is R Markdown?
-   Why should I use it?
-   R Markdown demo
-   Some real-life use cases

With slides adapted from Ulrik Lyngs\

# What is R Markdown?

## Wouldn't it be great if...

-   You could have code, results, and text in the same document?
-   Your results and plots were automatically generated from your data, so your documents were updated if your data changed?
-   The file format of your documents was future-proof?
-   The syntax for this was easy?

# Shine bright like a diamond
We have data about `r knitr::inline_expr("nrow(diamonds)")` diamonds.
Only `r knitr::inline_expr("nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)")` are larger than 2.5 carats. 
The distribution of the remainder is shown below:
`r ''````{r}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
